By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

-   Explain what a monolith is.
-   Discuss the monolith's challenges in the cloud.
-   Explain the concept of microservices.
-   Discuss microservices advantages in the cloud.
-   Describe the transformation path from a monolith to microservices.

## Big-Bang refractoring

A so-called "Big-bang" approach focuses all efforts with the refactoring of the monolith, postponing the development and implementation of any new features - essentially delaying progress and possibly, in the process, even breaking the core of the business, the monolith.

## Incremental refractoring

An incremental refactoring approach guarantees that new features are developed and implemented as modern microservices which are able to communicate with the monolith through APIs, without appending to the monolith's code. In the meantime, features are refactored out of the monolith which slowly fades away while all, or most its functionality is modernized into microservices. This incremental approach offers a gradual transition from a legacy monolith to modern microservices architecture and allows for phased migration of application features into the cloud.

Once an enterprise chose the refactoring path, there are other considerations in the process. Which business components to separate from the monolith to become distributed microservices, how to decouple the databases from the application to separate data complexity from application logic, and how to test the new microservices and their dependencies, are just a few of the decisions an enterprise is faced with during refactoring.

The refactoring phase slowly transforms the monolith into a cloud-native application which takes full advantage of cloud features, by coding in new programming languages and applying modern architectural patterns. Through refactoring, a legacy monolith application receives a second chance at life - to live on as a modular system adapted to fully integrate with today's fast-paced cloud automation tools and services.
