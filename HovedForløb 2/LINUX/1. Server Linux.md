## PFSense

The pfSense® Project is a free open source customized distribution of FreeBSD tailored for use as a firewall and router entirely managed by an easy-to-use web interface. This web interface is known as the web-based GUI configurator, or WebGUI for short. No FreeBSD knowledge is required to deploy and use pfSense software. In fact, the majority of users have never used FreeBSD outside of pfSense software. In addition to being a powerful, flexible firewalling and routing platform, pfSense software includes a long list of related features. The pfSense software package system allows further expandability without adding bloat and potential security vulnerabilities to the base distribution. pfSense software is a popular project with millions of downloads since its inception and hundreds of thousands of active installations. It has been proven successful in countless installations ranging from single computer protection in small home networks to thousands of network devices in large corporations, universities and other organizations.

### Project Inception

pfSense software was forked from the m0n0wall open source project in 2004. m0n0wall was focused specifically on providing a firewall/router for embedded devices and was sized for limited hardware resources. Initially pfSense software aimed at providing a firewall/router solution with an expanded set of capabilities on larger PC and server style hardware. pfSense software has continued to evolve over time, providing firewall, router, VPN, IDS/IPS, and more capabilities that work well on hardware from small home office size devices to large service provider size servers.

## Debian

[Debian-projektet](https://www.debian.org/) er en sammenslutning af personer, der har det fælles mål, at fremstille et frit styresystem. Det styresystem kalder vi **Debian**.

Et styresystem er de basale programmer og værktøjer, der får din computer til at fungere. Hjertet i et styresystem er kernen. Kernen er det mest fundamentale program på computeren; den tager sig af alle de basale gøremål og giver dig mulighed for at køre andre programmer.

Debian-systemer anvender i øjeblikket [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/)-kernen eller [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)-kernen. Linux er et program startet af [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), og støttet af tusindvis af programmører over hele verden. FreeBSD er et styresystem, herunder en kerne og anden software.

Men der arbejdes også på, at Debian kan køre med andre kerner, primært [Hurd](https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html). Hurd er en samling servere, der kører oven på en mikrokerne (som for eksempel Mach), for at implementere forskellige funktioner. Hurd er fri software, produceret af [GNU-projektet](https://www.gnu.org/).

En stor del af de basale værktøjer, der udgør styresystemet, kommer fra GNU-projektet; deraf navnene: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD og GNU/Hurd. Disse værktøjer er også frit tilgængelige.

Selvfølgelig er det applikationsprogrammer, folk vil have: programmer der kan hjælpe dem med at udføre forskellige opgaver, lige fra redigering af dokumenter til at drive en virksomhed, computerspil, eller programudvikling. Debian indeholder mere end 59000 [pakker](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages) (prækompilerede programmer i en pæn indpakning, lige til at installere på din maskine), et pakkehåndteringsprogram (APT), samt andre værktøjer, som gør det muligt at håndtere tusindvis af pakker på tusindvis af computere, så let som at installere en enkelt applikation. Det hele er frit tilgængeligt.

## Det hele er frit tilgængeligt?

Du undrer dig måske over, hvorfor folk bruger timevis af deres fritid på at skrive programmer, omhyggeligt pakke dem sammen, for blot at _forære_ det hele væk? Svarene er lige så forskellige som de personer, der bidrager. Nogle kan lide at hjælpe andre. Mange skriver programmer for at lære mere om computere. Flere og flere søger efter muligheder for at undgå de opskruede priser på programmer. En voksende gruppe bidrager som tak for al den gode, frie software, de har modtaget fra andre. Mange i den akademiske verden udvikler fri software for at gøre resultatet af deres forskning tilgængelig for flere. Virksomheder hjælper til ved vedligeholdelsen af fri software, så de kan få indflydelse på hvordan den udvikler sig - der er ingen hurtigere måde at få lavet en ny funktion på, end ved selv at gøre det! Selvfølgelig synes mange af os, at det bare er sjovt at være med.

Debian er så engageret i fri software, at vi mente det kunne være nyttigt, hvis engagementet var formaliseret i en eller anden form for dokument. Sådan blev vores sociale kontrakt født.

Selv om Debian går ind for fri software, er der tilfælde hvor man ønsker, eller kan være nødt til, at installere ikke-frie programmer på sine maskiner. Så vidt det overhovedet er muligt, støtter Debian dette. Der er endda et stigende antal pakker hvis eneste formål er at installere ikke-frie programmer på et Debian-system.

## DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through [domain names](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-a-domain-name/), like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through [Internet Protocol (IP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/internet-protocol/) addresses. DNS translates domain names to [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

## How does DNS work?

The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.

In order to understand the process behind the DNS resolution, it’s important to learn about the different hardware components a DNS query must pass between. For the web browser, the DNS lookup occurs "behind the scenes" and requires no interaction from the user’s computer apart from the initial request.

## Webserver

The term _web server_ can refer to hardware or software, or both of them working together.

1.  On the hardware side, a web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (for example, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). A web server connects to the Internet and supports physical data interchange with other devices connected to the web.
2.  On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a minimum, this is an _HTTP server_. An HTTP server is software that understands [URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL) (web addresses) and [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP) (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.

At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) _HTTP server_ accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP. (If the server doesn't find the requested document, it returns a [404](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) response instead.)

![Basic representation of a client/server connection through HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server/web-server.svg)

To publish a website, you need either a static or a dynamic web server.

A **static web server**, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it "static" because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser.

A **dynamic web server** consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an _application server_ and a _database_. We call it "dynamic" because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server.

For example, to produce the final webpages you see in the browser, the application server might fill an HTML template with content from a database. Sites like MDN or Wikipedia have thousands of webpages. Typically, these kinds of sites are composed of only a few HTML templates and a giant database, rather than thousands of static HTML documents. This setup makes it easier to maintain and deliver the content.

## Filserver

In computing, a **file server** (or **fileserver**) is a computer attached to a network that provides a location for shared disk access, i.e. storage of computer files (such as text, image, sound, video) that can be accessed by the workstations that are able to reach the computer that shares the access through a computer network. The term server highlights the role of the machine in the traditional [client–server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server "Client–server") scheme, where the clients are the workstations using the storage. A file server does not normally perform computational tasks or run programs on behalf of its client workstations.

File servers are commonly found in schools and offices, where users use a [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") to connect their client computers.

## PHP Server

PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.

The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.

W3Techs reports that, as of October 2022, "PHP is used by 74.4% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know." PHP version 7.4 is the most used version. Support for version 7.3 was dropped on 6 December 2021.

## Database Server

_Database servers_ are used to store and manage databases that are stored on the server and to provide data access for authorized users. This type of server keeps the data in a central location that can be regularly backed up. It also allows users and applications to centrally access the data across the network. A large number of the databases used in your organization can be kept on one server or a group of servers that are specifically configured to protect data and service client requests.

The Configure Your Server Wizard does not include a configurable role for database servers. A database server is any server that runs a network database application and maintains database files, such as Microsoft [SQL](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/structured-query-language "Learn more about SQL from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") Server or Oracle. SQL Server is a high-performance [database management system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/database-management-system "Learn more about database management system from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). It is used for data storage and analysis, and it provides users with the ability to access vast amounts of data quickly over the network. Because SQL Server provides additional measures of security that would not otherwise be available (as discussed in the “Securing Database Servers” section later in this chapter) and processing occurs on the server, transactions can occur securely and rapidly.

Data stored in [database management systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/database-management-system "Learn more about database management systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is generally accessed through [user interfaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-interface "Learn more about user interfaces from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that are developed by an organization or third parties. For example, a company might create custom applications in Visual Basic (or some other programming language), or use [ASP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/active-server-page "Learn more about ASP from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on the Web server to display information that is stored in a database. While the user interacts with the data through the [user interface](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/user-interface "Learn more about user interface from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the data is actually stored in the SQL Server or [Oracle database](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/oracle-database "Learn more about Oracle database from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") located on a database server.

## Raid

## Understanding RAID

Damage to the enterprise, caused by disk failure, has become a correspondingly heavier burden as disk capacity use has grown.  
Storage system downtime can mean companies fail to take full advantage of business opportunities because of the management overheads of securing important data.

RAID technology not only prevents such data loss and failure but also enhances business performance.

This content covers the topics of RAID technology from its processes to use.

## What is RAID?

RAID is an acronym for "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks".  
When interpreted literally, it means storing information across an array of relatively low cost hard disk drives (HDDs). It is generally considered to be "Technology that combines numbers of such inexpensive HDDs into a single HDD."

RAID is the use of multiple disks to manage HDD data using a range of different techniques. These are typically divided into 6 levels ; RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 2, RAID 3, RAID 4, RAID 5. They all differ in terms of data deployment and the type of redundancy offered.  
Now Fujitsu provides RAID 6 with it's ETERNUS DX and ETERNUS AF. This ensures enhanced reliability through use of double parity.

The technology was initially proposed by a study group of Professor. Patterson at the University of California. When they presented their paper, the "I" in RAID represented "Inexpensive". This was because they were seeking ways to use the inexpensive HDDs that were on the market, in their study, instead of the proprietary and rather exclusive disk devices commonly used at that time to improve disk drive speed and reliability.

But today, as expensive dedicated HDDs have all but disappeared from the market, the "I" in RAID has come to represent "Independent".

It has also become popular to mix and match the various RAID level technologies to provide more specific cost reductions and performance enhancements.

Both software RAID and hardware RAID are available for installation.  
Software RAID can be implemented through features that combine multiple disk devices connected directly to a host computer (typically via a SCSI interface) and regard them as a single logical memory device. This feature introduced with the operating systems Windows NT/2000 is commonly used.

With Hardware RAID, a control component, independent of the host CPU implements RAID. The two most popular methods of Hardware RAID are via PCI bus connection to the host computer using a card, or integrated with the disk drive and connected to the host computer via fibre channel or SCSI.  
Hardware RAID is by far the most common method in full-fledged server systems, as it places no additional processing burdens on the server.

Let's look at the details of the different RAID technology levels.

## RAID level

-   [RAID 0](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid0.html)
-   [RAID 1](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid1.html)
-   [RAID 1+0](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid10.html)
-   [RAID 2](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid2.html)
-   [RAID 3](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid3.html)

-   [RAID 4](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid4.html)
-   [RAID 5](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid5.html)
-   [RAID 5+0](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid50.html)
-   [RAID 6](https://www.fujitsu.com/global/products/computing/storage/eternus/glossary/raid/raid6.html)

## Proxy

A **proxy server** is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an [IP address](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-ip-address). This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.

### Proxy Servers and Network Security

Proxies provide a valuable layer of security for your computer. They can be set up as web filters or [firewall](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/firewall-defined)s, protecting your computer from internet threats like [malware](https://www.fortinet.com/content/fortinet-com/en_us).

This extra security is also valuable when coupled with a [secure web gateway](https://www.fortinet.com/products/secure-web-gateway) or other [email security](https://www.fortinet.com/products/email-security) products. This way, you can filter traffic according to its level of safety or how much traffic your network—or individual computers—can handle.

How to use a proxy? Some people use proxies for personal purposes, such as hiding their location while watching movies online, for example. For a company, however, they can be used to accomplish several key tasks such as:

1.  Improve security
2.  Secure employees’ internet activity from people trying to snoop on them
3.  Balance internet traffic to prevent crashes
4.  Control the websites employees and staff access in the office
5.  Save bandwidth by caching files or compressing incoming traffic
