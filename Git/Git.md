Introduction
============================

From the [official website](https://git-scm.com):

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  
> 
> The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model. 
> 
> Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

Although git is an incredibly powerful tool in its own right, it is often used in combination with repository management systems, like [Github](https://github.com), both to support cooporation on large OSS projects, but also as a personal tool to keep files and projects in sync across multiple devices.

Git is incredibly sophisticated under the hood, but expose a relatively simple, high-level
interface. It doesn't take long to become productive with it, but there is still some learning curve involved.  
 
These documents aim to provide a few resources to ease the beginning a bit, and slightly flatten that curve.
