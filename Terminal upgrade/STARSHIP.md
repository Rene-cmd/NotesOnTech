#setup #linux #terminal
Starship is a cross-shell prompt that is designed to be fast, powerful, and customizable. It is written in Rust and can be used on any system that has a compatible terminal emulator, such as macOS, Linux, and Windows.

To install Starship on your system, you will need to have the Rust programming language installed. You can check if Rust is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code

`rustc --version`

If Rust is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have Rust installed, you can install Starship by running the following command:

Copy code

`cargo install starship`

This will download and compile the latest version of Starship, and install it on your system. You can then use the `starship` command to customize and run the prompt.

For more information on how to use and customize Starship, you can consult the documentation on the Starship GitHub page: [https://starship.rs/](https://starship.rs/)
